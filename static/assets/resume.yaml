aboutme:
  tagline: Because you wanna hear more than just my love affair with Linux
  text: For me, security and technology are deep rooted passions going back to my curiousity when I first started using computers. I love the fast paced, constantly changing world of information security, and I was instantly drawn to positions that allowed me to make a difference and more importantly enjoy every aspect of what I do. From pentests to reviewing vulnerabilities, from policies to forensic investigations, I love all of it. I live and breathe systems and security, and I couldn't be happier working in the most amazing field ever. I fell head over heels for Linux a while ago, and have never looked back. Overall, I love what I do, and would love to do what I love for you.
